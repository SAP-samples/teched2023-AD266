# Exercise 2 - Understand the existing Project setup

In this exercise, we will look at existing files to understand the project structure.

## Exercise 2.1 CDS Maven Plugin

In your application's pom.xml, under the `plugins` section you can see the [`cds-maven-plugin`](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java/assets/cds-maven-plugin-site/plugin-info.html) entry.
The interesting part here is the `generate` goal which is responsible for scanning project directories for CDS files and generating Java POJOs for type-safe access to the CDS model.

From your project's source directory, run `mvn clean compile` and you can see the generated classes being added to `srv/src/gen/java`.

## Exercise 2.2 Understanding Service Definitions

Services are one of the core concepts of CAP, they are declared in [CDS](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#service-definitions-in-cds), and they dispatch events to `Event Handlers`.
Let's examine the `/srv/service.cds` file which defines the services exposed by our application:
   
1. We will examine the `SignupService` and the `GoalService`. 

2. The `SignupService` is a service that just exposes an action. The action takes a `String` Session as input.
   ```
   @path: 'SignupService'
   service SignupService {
   action signUp(session: String);
   }
   ```
   The `@path` argument allows you to provide a custom path for the exposed service. The `SignupService` would be available when the application starts up at path: //Todo

3. The `GoalService` is a service that exposes an entity `Goal` which is a projection on the `Goal_101` entity exposed by the SuccessFactors Goal Plan API.
   ```
   @path: 'GoalService'
   service GoalService {
     entity Goal as projection on Goal_101 {
     id,
     name as title,
     metric as description,
     done as completion,
     }
   }
   ```
   The `GoalService` would be available when the application starts up at path: //Todo

## Exercise 2.3 Understanding EventHandlers

In the previous section, we learnt that `Service`s dispatch events to `Event Handlers`.
Event handlers are the ones that then implement the behaviour of the service.

1. Let's examine the event handler for the `SignupService` in the file `/srv/SignupHandler.java`.

2. The `@ServiceName(SignupService_.CDS_NAME)` annotation at the top of the class specifies the service which the event handler is registered on. 

3. The `@On( event = SignUpContext.CDS_NAME)` annotation on top of the method `signUp(context)` specifies the `Event Phase` at which the method would be called.
   An `Event` can be processed in three phases: `Before`, `On` and `After`. As we are defining the core business logic of the action, we are using the `On` phase.
   What this means is that everytime the `signUp(session)` action is called, this triggers an event and the `signUp(context)` method would be called.

4. `Event Contexts` provide a way to access the parameters and return values. `SignUpContext` is the event context here, which helps us to access the action parameter, additional query parameters and other information of the incoming request.
   It would also be eventually used to set the return value of the action.

5. Note that some imports used in the class like `SignupService_`,`SignUpContext` were all generated by the CDS Maven Plugin.

6. Similarly, for the `GoalService`, the event handler is defined in the file `/srv/GoalHandler.java`.

7. The only difference here is that we define methods for handling Create (`CqnService.EVENT_CREATE`), Read (`CqnService.EVENT_READ`) and Delete (`CqnService.EVENT_DELETE`) events instead using `@On` annotation.
   In the upcoming exercises we will write the business logic for all these methods.

//TODO maybe the participants should run the app once here and call an endpoint just to see the handler is invoked?

## Summary

You've now successfully understood the existing files in your project. Let's now go add some code to get the application working.
